# Iâ€™m currently learning these languages:

I Prefere Javascript over python, (python sucks), because javascript is more versatile. Javascript is better because you can do more with it, expecially in the web browser setting. Ive "coded" a few games with this language so far, linked here:

[Terrible implementation of Snake](http://kdoshi.42web.io/game/game.html)
<br>
[A game where you try to survive as long as possible, dodging the falling obstacles](http://kdoshi.42web.io/game/game2.html)
<br>
[Definitely my best game, a simple version of Pong](http://kdoshi.42web.io/game/game3.html)
<br>
[A somewhat decent version of the game 2048](http://kdoshi.42web.io/game/game4.html)
